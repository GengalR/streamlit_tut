## What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build and share interactive web applications for data 
science and machine learning projects. It allows you to create web apps using just Python, without needing to 
know front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## When to use Streamlit?
- Data Science & Machine Learning Apps – If you need a quick, interactive UI for a data science or ML model.
- Prototyping & Rapid Development – Build and share a proof of concept in minutes.
- Interactive Dashboards – Easily display data with charts, tables, and widgets.
- Internal Tools – Quick internal applications for non-technical users.
- Minimal Backend Needs – If your app mainly runs in Python and doesn’t require complex authentication, databases, or background tasks.

## When not to use Streamlit?
- You Need a Full Web Application – Streamlit is not meant for complex web apps with multiple pages, users, or custom frontend styling.
- Database-heavy Applications – Flask/Django are better suited for apps that require relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) with ORM support.
- Authentication & User Management – If you need login, registration, roles, and permissions, Django (with Django Auth) or Flask (with Flask-Login) is a better choice.
- Performance & Scalability – Streamlit runs everything on the backend, making it slower for large-scale applications. Flask/Django can optimize database queries, caching, and load balancing.
- REST APIs – If you need a backend API that serves multiple front-end clients (React, Angular, etc.), use Flask or Django REST Framework (DRF).

## Conclusion
Streamlit is perfect for short and data-focused web applications that require minimal backend logic. It’s great for prototyping, internal tools, and quick data science projects.
However, for more complex web applications with databases, authentication, and scalability requirements, Flask or Django might be a better choice.
